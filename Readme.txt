 we can't upload the code with training and testing images.
Therefore, we have separated the training and testing images from the code and report.
In this folder, there are:
	-Code
	-Report
        -batch files
        -created Atlas

Please put the training images inside "training_image\training-images" and their labels and masks 
in "training_dataset\labels" and "training_image\\training-mask" respectively.

For the testing images inside "test_set\testing-images" and their labels and masks 
in "testing_dataset\labels" and "test_set\testing-labels" respectively. 

We are very sorry for the inconvenience. 
Let us know if there any unclear part in specifing the path datasets and files.
